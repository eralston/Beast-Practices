# Usability

It is best when building a product to consistently reference this list and build the product to meet these standards and avoid retroactively fixing them. This is achieved by user research, user testing, design reviews, staying current with UX/UI best practices and trends, and working with the development team.

## Usability Principles
---
The following areas describe the criteria for good Usability.

**Visibility of system status.** Users should always be informed of system operations with easy to understand and highly visible status displayed on the screen within a reasonable amount of time.

Slways keep people informed about what is going on.

Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**Match between system and the real world.** Designers should endeavor to mirror the language and concepts users would find in the real world based on who their target users are. Presenting information in logical order and piggybacking on user's expectations derived from their real-world experiences will reduce cognitive strain and make systems easier to use.

Speak the persons language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the person, rather than system-oriented terms.

Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

**User control and freedom.** Offer users a digital space where backward steps are possible, including undoing and redoing previous actions.

People often choose system functions by mistake.

Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.

Support undo and redo.

**Consistency and standards.** Interface designers should ensure that both the graphic elements and terminology are maintained across similar platforms. For example, an icon that represents one category or concept should not represent a different concept when used on a different screen.

People should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

Follow platform conventions.

**Error prevention.** Whenever possible, design systems so that potential errors are kept to a minimum. Users do not like being called upon to detect and remedy problems, which may on occasion be beyond their level of expertise. Eliminating or flagging actions that may result in errors are two possible means of achieving error prevention.

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.

**Recognition rather than recall.** Minimize cognitive load by maintaining task-relevant information within the display while users explore the interface. Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Due to the limitations of short-term memory, designers should ensure users can simply employ recognition instead of recalling information across parts of the dialogue. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory and allowing relevant information to surface. For example, we often find the format of multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions on a test because it only requires us to recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory.

Make objects, actions, and options visible.

People should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.

Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

**Flexibility and efficiency of use.** With increased use comes the demand for less interactions that allow faster navigation. This can be achieved by using abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands and macro facilities. Users should be able to customize or tailor the interface to suit their needs so that frequent actions can be achieved through more convenient means.

Accelerators -- unseen by the novice person -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert person so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced people.

Allow people to tailor frequent actions.

**Aesthetic and minimalist design.** Keep clutter to a minimum. All unnecessary information competes for the user's limited attentional resources, which could inhibit user's memory retrieval of relevant information. Therefore, the display must be reduced to only the necessary components for the current tasks, whilst providing clearly visible and unambiguous means of navigating to other content.

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

**Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors.** Designers should assume users are unable to understand technical terminology, therefore, error messages should almost always be expressed in plain language to ensure nothing gets lost in translation.

Expressed in plain language (no codes)

Precisely indicate the problem

Constructively suggest a solution

**Help and documentation.** Ideally, we want users to navigate the system without having to resort to documentation. However, depending on the type of solution, documentation may be necessary. When users require help, ensure it is easily located, specific to the task at hand and worded in a way that will guide them through the necessary steps towards a solution to the issue they are facing.

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.

Help information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
